Hola a todos, thank you in advance for your feedback!

Angela, your project looks great! It is nice not only because of the fancy topic but also you already have the data at hand that are ready to go for analyses.

What was done well: You have got the questions in the survey that I think you will using for structuring your analyses, i.e, entering into models as variables. It is also clear to me as to how you would do the data analyses, i.e., extracting utterances with the keywords for common themes, which I feel like is quite feasible and doable.

One suggestion for improvement: Given the data and proposed data analysis, I am curious about the specific research questions you would formulate and how each expected result would answer your RQs especially when you mentioned the Sociolinguistics class project - would its research questions be different from the ones you intended for this class? 

One thing I learned: I am always interested in learning more about the use of data to answer sociolinguistic questions.
