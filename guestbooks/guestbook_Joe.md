Joe! Overall this looks fantastic, and I can't wait to see the end result. You've put a lot of thought into the initial design, which will definitely help you stay focused as you continue with the analysis. 

**What was done well** - Your description of the variants is very thorough, and you have a lot to work with! I like how you listed the (16!) possibilities and provided specific examples of the features. It is also clear that the features are supported by previous research, which is always good to have. 

**One suggestion for improvement** - It was a little unclear to me whether some of the features were phonetic or morphological, and if so, does that affect your analysis? For example, the r-drop- if it is purely phonetic, my guess is that it would still appear in written transcriptions... this is something that you probably already have under control, but that is one thought I had while reading. 

**One thing I learned** - I always enjoy seeing traits that appear in other languages, and I didn't know that r-dropping is also a feature in Serbo-Croatian varieties! It makes me wonder what status it has, who most uses it, etc.
