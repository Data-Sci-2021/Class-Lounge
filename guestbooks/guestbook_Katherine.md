Nice work so far, Katherine! I look forward to seeing the final results. :)

**Something you did well** - I think that it makes perfect sense to use data that you already have from your dissertation, and organize it/ analyze it differently! I also appreciate that you are comparing a variety of L1s (not just Romance languages, for example). 

**One suggestion for improvement** - It would be good to have a few explanations for your predictions- for example, why do you anticipate that L1 Chinese learners would have higher accuracy ratings when compared to L1 Hebrew or French (or is it Spanish? You mention both.)? Not knowing much about it, I would have thought that an L1 Spanish or French student might have higher spelling accuracy due to cognates and sharing a writing system. I'm sure you have many good reasons after working with the data for so long, just be sure to make them explicit! 

**Something I learned** - I think it's interesting to compare across types, so I look forward to seeing what you find in the data! One thing that I learned outside of this class that may help you automatize the spelling scores is called a fuzzy-string matcher. All you have to do is upload a file with the existing word list in one row and the participant transcriptions in another, and it will give an intelligibility score for each token.
