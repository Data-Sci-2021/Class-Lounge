I can totally relate to your concerns about sharing the data! I just learned from a librarian that putting a dataset into a repository safely is a project itself. I liked that you did the transcription. There are so many software that can do automated transcription that might speed up your transcription process but I am not sure if they have the option for Spanish. You can check it out to see if it is helpful.

I really liked that you found theoretical and empirical support for the linguistics markers of dialect between the varieties of Serbo-Croatian. My analysis is exploratory due to the lack of evidence in the literature. 
I agree that you can choose some features for this class project. I went through the 16 variables and I noticed that variable #9 "some inflected forms look like other common words." I don't know Serbian or Croatian but I'm thinking maybe you can try to use POS tagging to screen all the words to separate question word and other words in inflected forms
