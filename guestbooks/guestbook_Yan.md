Rossina's comments:

*What was done well?* You have performed a lot of work to merge the datasets. I am glad that you were also able to identify what is missing through this process. We had discussed in class that what you want to undertake is massive. I think that you are moving bravely to research the questions that excite you. You excluded sociodemographic factors for now, which is fair, but I think it would interesting to see the connections between controllability and race/gender/employment in the future.

*Suggestion for improvement*: As a reader, I want to care about your study. You have one sentence describing your study in README file. If you add one more sentence what controllability is, how you define and operationalize it, I think I will care about your study even more. 

*What did I learn?* I learned that if full_join() does not work, you need to use merge().
