I can totally relate to your concerns about sharing the data! I just learned from a librarian that putting a dataset into a repository safely is a project itself. I liked that you did the transcription. There are so many software that can do automated transcription that might speed up your transcription process but I am not sure if they have the option for Spanish. You can check it out to see if it is helpful.

I really liked that you found theoretical and empirical support for the linguistics markers of dialect between the varieties of Serbo-Croatian. My analysis is exploratory due to the lack of evidence in the literature. 
I agree that you can choose some features for this class project. I went through the 16 variables and I noticed that variable #9 "some inflected forms look like other common words." I don't know Serbian or Croatian but I'm thinking maybe you can try to use POS tagging to screen all the words to separate question word and other words in inflected forms

Rossina's comments:

*What was done well?* You have performed a lot of work to merge the datasets. I am glad that you were also able to identify what is missing through this process. We had discussed in class that what you want to undertake is massive. I think that you are moving bravely to research the questions that excite you. You excluded sociodemographic factors for now, which is fair, but I think it would interesting to see the connections between controllability and race/gender/employment in the future.

*Suggestion for improvement*: As a reader, I want to care about your study. You have one sentence describing your study in README file. If you add one more sentence what controllability is, how you define and operationalize it, I think I will care about your study even more. 

*What did I learn?* I learned that if full_join() does not work, you need to use merge().
