Rossina's comments:

*What is done well?* I am glad that you are aiming for publication. Your csv files look beautiful. You have accomplished a lot in coding. It is clear that you have a goal in mind, and you have put in time in your project. 

*One suggestion for improvement*: I would love to see a better spelled out rationale for the study. I can see that your project is thought-out but you have not shared with the audience why we should care about your study.

*What did I learn?* I have not seen the code for regression modeling before. This is something I considered dipping my toes into but felt too intimidated. If I ever want to perform regression modeling myself, I will look over your code and learn how you approached the task.
